## Project Description
TasteBud is an application that teaches beginner cooks how to cook recipes from different cuisines, but are unsure where to start. This project is being developed for the CS 346 course project in Winter 2024. It differs from other similar applications by using a progression learning method where users can learn the basics of cooking a specific cuisine and gradually increase their expertise. It solves the problem of overwhelming online cooking information and recipes, which often assume prior knowledge of cooking and have limited information on each of the steps for preparing a dish. Youtube videos and other social media platforms are also often too fast-paced and vague. Users are searching for a quick & convenient, user friendly, and fun way to learn cooking!
